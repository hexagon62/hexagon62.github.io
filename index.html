            <h1>In light of Discord's recent decisions,</h1>
            <p>
                I want to address the fragility of the platforms you and I use to keep in contact with friends.
                Every once in a while, platforms play hot potato with us. It's the nature of the internet.
                I know many people may jump ship from Discord, and I might do so as well, but I would like to minimize the loss of contact during that process.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Please remember to have multiple methods of contact with anybody you care enough about to keep around.</strong>
                Don't make things hard on yourself by having only one method of contact with people you like.
                That method can be stripped away or tarnished at a moment's notice.
                Don't ever get too comfortable with one platform.
            </p>
