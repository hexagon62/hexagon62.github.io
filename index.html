            <h1>In light of Discord's recent decisions</h1>
            <p>
                I want to address the fragility of the platforms you and I use to keep in contact with friends.
                Every once in a while, platforms play hot potato with us.
                It's the nature of the internet at this point.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know some people might jump ship from Discord, so just in-case...
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Have multiple methods of contact with anybody you care enough about to keep around!</strong><br/>
                Don't make things hard on yourself by having only one method of contact with people you like.
                That method can be stripped away or tarnished at a moment's notice.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, I'm going to make it easy on you when it comes to me.
            </p>
            <h2>Alternative contact methods</h2>
            <p class="center">
                This list will be expanded as I explore more ways to get in touch with people.

                        This is probably the best way to reach me outside of Discord.
