            <h1>Regarding Discord's recent decisions</h1>
            <p>
                Today, we learn the hard lesson that lumping all our eggs in one big basket is a bad idea.
                I don't know what we'll ultimately end up using if we have to jump ship,
                but ideally it will be broken up into many small baskets. That said...
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Have multiple ways to contact anybody you care about keeping around!</strong><br/>
                Don't make things hard on yourself by having only one method of contact with people you like.
                You're just one bad policy or change away from losing that.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, I'm going to make it easy on you when it comes to me.
            </p>
            <h2>Alternative contact methods</h2>
            <ul class="contacts">
                <li>
                    <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/hexabug/" target="_blank">Steam</a>
                    <a href="javascript:setClipboard('https://steamcommunity.com/id/hexabug/')" class="copy">(click here to copy)</a>
                    <small>
                        Best way to reach me that isn't Discord.
                        Only issue is text chat isn't logged or searchable,
                        which means it won't be good for collaboration or sharing stuff.

                        I will take it down later this year.
                        If you verify who you are, you can have the real email.

                        The main instance <a href="https://stoat.chat/legal/community-guidelines#jurisdiction">partly operates in the UK</a>,
                        so treat it as a temporary solution.
                        Self-hosting is possible and should be considered the long-term solution.
