                            Best way to reach me that isn't Discord.
                            Only issue is text chat isn't logged or searchable,
                            which means it won't be good for collaboration or sharing stuff.

                <h1>Regarding Discord's recent decisions</h1>
                <p>
                    I've known Discord would do something stupid for years; just not this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, we learn the hard lesson that lumping all our eggs in one big basket is a bad idea.
                    I don't know what we'll ultimately end up using if we have to jump ship,
                    but ideally it will be broken up into many small baskets. That said...
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Have multiple ways to contact anybody you care about keeping around!</strong><br/>
                    Don't make things hard on yourself by having only one method of contact with people you like.
                    You're just one bad policy or change away from losing that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyways, I'm going to make it easy on you to find me if you need to.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h1>Another Update (2026-02-13)</h1>
                <p>
                    Even though it is not yet March,
                    some friends of mine are already reporting messages being filtered
                    due to Discord's age restrictions and spam filters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I won't be posting proof here, since I respect their privacy.
                    A screenshot really wouldn't prove much anyways because anybody can fake one.
                    So take this with a grain of salt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It doesn't change anything above,
                    but it shows me that Discord is lying through their teeth
                    when they say their teen-until-proven-adult policy should hardly affect anybody.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oh, and don't forget how they're trying to defend this all:
                    They straight-up admitted to feeding your data to a model that predicts your demographics!
                    Not that this is new information.
                    For the longest time, many people were able to download their data and see that Discord was trying to guess their age & gender.
                    Try it for yourself!
