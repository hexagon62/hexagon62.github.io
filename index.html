                    <p>
                        The NY times published <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/13/technology/dhs-anti-ice-social-media.html">this article</a> recently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Still, not an outright operational association with Discord, but still pretty bad.
                        I mean, it's the government, they could probably already figure out who you are if they really wanted to.
                        However, this is just going to make it easier and support an authoritarian regime that doesn't like people saying mean things about it.

                    <p>
                        A friend shared
                        <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/oh-good-discords-age-verification-rollout-has-ties-to-palantir-co-founder-and-panopticon-architect-peter-thiel/">
                            this article
                        </a>
                        with me.
                        Unfortunately, after searching for information, it <em>appears to be</em> true (not that I'm 100% sure).
                        While Peter Thiel seems to only be involved as an investor and not operationally,
                        it's entirely possible that in the future Discord will be compromised and feeding your data to ICE too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I would say this just adds to the reasons you should start being less dependent on Discord,
                        but it might just be too late to stop your data from falling into their hands.
                        All you can do now is stop feeding them more.

                    <h2>Another Update (2026-02-13)</h2>
                    <p>
                        Even though it is not yet March,
                        some friends of mine are already reporting messages being filtered
                        due to Discord's age restrictions and spam filters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I won't be posting proof here, since I respect their privacy.
                        A screenshot really wouldn't prove much anyways because anybody can fake one.
                        So take this with a grain of salt.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It doesn't change anything above,
                        but it shows me that Discord is lying through their teeth
                        when they say their teen-until-proven-adult policy should hardly affect anybody.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Oh, and don't forget how they're trying to defend this all:
                        They straight-up admitted to feeding your data to a model that predicts your demographics!
                        Not that this is new information.
                        For the longest time, many people were able to download their data and see that Discord was trying to guess their age & gender.
                        Try it for yourself!

                        Today, we learn the hard lesson that lumping all our eggs in one big basket is a bad idea.
                        I don't know what we'll ultimately end up using if we have to jump ship,
                        but ideally it will be broken up into many small baskets. That said...
