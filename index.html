            <h1>Another Update (2026-02-13)</h1>
            <p>
                Even though it is not yet March,
                some friends of mine are already reporting messages being filtered
                due to Discord's age restrictions and spam filters.
            </p>
            <p>
                I won't be posting proof here, since I respect their privacy.
                A screenshot really wouldn't prove much anyways because anybody can fake one.
                So take this with a grain of salt.
            </p>
            <p>
                It doesn't change anything below,
                but it shows me that Discord is lying through their teeth
                when they say their teen-until-proven-adult policy should hardly affect anybody.
            </p>
            <h1>Regarding Discord's recent decisions</h1>
            <p>
                Today, we learn the hard lesson that lumping all our eggs in one big basket is a bad idea.
                I don't know what we'll ultimately end up using if we have to jump ship,
                but ideally it will be broken up into many small baskets. That said...
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Have multiple ways to contact anybody you care about keeping around!</strong><br/>
                Don't make things hard on yourself by having only one method of contact with people you like.
                You're just one bad policy or change away from losing that.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm not immediately leaving Discord, but I am making efforts to wean off of it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyways, I'm going to make it easy on you to find me if you need to.
            </p>

                        Best way to reach me that isn't Discord.
                        Only issue is text chat isn't logged or searchable,
                        which means it won't be good for collaboration or sharing stuff.

                        Self-hosting is possible and should be considered the long-term solution.
