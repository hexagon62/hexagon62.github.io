            <h1>Regarding Discord's recent decisions</h1>
            <p>
                Today, we learn the hard lesson that lumping all our eggs in one big basket is a bad idea.
                I don't know what we'll ultimately end up using if we have to jump ship,
                but ideally it will be broken up into many small baskets. That said...
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Have multiple ways to contact anybody you care about keeping around!</strong><br/>
                Don't make things hard on yourself by having only one method of contact with people you like.
                You're just one bad policy or change away from losing that.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, I'm going to make it easy on you when it comes to me.
            </p>
            <h2>Alternative contact methods</h2>
            <p class="center">
                This list will be expanded as I explore more ways to get in touch with people.
            </p>
            <ul class="contacts">
                <li>
                    <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/hexabug/" target="_blank">Steam</a>
                    <a href="javascript:setClipboard('https://steamcommunity.com/id/hexabug/')" class="copy">(click here to copy)</a>
                    <small>
                        This is probably the best way to reach me.
                        Outside of Discord anyways.

                        I will take it down later this year.
                        If you verify who you are, you can have the real email.

                        Seems to be in development, but it's something!
                        We'll see if I'm active on it later...
